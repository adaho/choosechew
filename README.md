ChooseChew is an app that aims to help hungry, indecisive users decide on a place to eat at. The app can randomly generate a nearby restaurant using the user's GPS location. The app will also have a create account and login option available for the user to access his/her account and be able to create a Favorites list that will automatically be saved to the user's account.
